# Semester 6 Jupyter notebooks

Each notebook corresponds to a lesson from a course. If there are no tasks in a lesson, the notebook is highly likely empty or contains only `md` cells

## Speedrun?

Every notebook has a timestamp of how much time elapsed from me opening the lesson until the last task is confirmed to give the proper results. Fun!

- START: Opened link of a lesson in `cs.mipt.ru/advanced_python`
- FINISH: Results of the last cell confirmed to be correct.

Have a nice day reading all of this!

*Also, I've made a small "Quest" that helps new Python users get to know how it works. It's not finished, but I hade much fun writing it. See for yourself if you want: [Studying with Red Cardinal](https://github.com/DeVasti/Studing_with_Red_Cardinal)
