We value your projects and what you have already done to our university, but it's more clear now than ever, that students lack a place to rest or communicate with each other.
Right now we already have a dozen of different labs and project-oriented complexes, but the amount of leisure space is insufficient, to say the least.
Currently, we may consider only LK entrance and GK 2-floor hall as such and we think that this is not enough.
